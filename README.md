# AutoML: based on Optuna & SHAP values for feature selection

## Description

This project is currently in development and aims to aggregate a set of training scripts created for various machine learning projects. The primary focus is on unsupervised model training (full cycle) to expedite the model development process.

## Features

- **Unsupervised Model Training**: Streamlines machine learning model development by focusing on unsupervised techniques.
- **Optuna Integration with 'Patience' Feature**: Enhances hyperparameter optimization speed in Optuna by integrating a 'patience' mechanism.
- **Custom Algorithm for Feature Selection**: Utilizes SHAP values to determine the most impactful features, improving model accuracy and interpretability.
- **Calibration Step for Classification Tasks**: Adds a calibration phase to classification models, further refining performance and reliability.
- **Customizable and Adaptable**: Designed to be flexible, accommodating various machine learning tasks and datasets.
- **Ongoing Development**: Continuously evolving with planned enhancements and improvements to keep the project up-to-date and effective.
